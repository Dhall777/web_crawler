# WebCrawler

- Basic web crawler in Elixir. Simple enough to be extendable.

1. Run the project `iex -S mix`
2. Crawl the website you're interested in `WebCrawler.Crawler.crawl("https://your.favorite.website./", 2)`
3. It will report how many links it has crawled in its adventures.
4. Extend the app :)
